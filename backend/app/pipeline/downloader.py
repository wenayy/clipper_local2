"""Fetches source media with yt-dlp.

Two important performance decisions live here:

1. Audio is downloaded on its own, first. Transcription only needs audio, and
   the audio stream is a few MB against a video's hundreds. If the transcript
   yields nothing usable we never pay for the video download at all.

2. The video is capped at 1080p. render.py composes a 1080x1920 frame, so
   anything above that is downscaled and thrown away -- and YouTube's top
   formats are now 4K AV1, which is both enormous (>1GB) and slow to decode.
   Preferring avc1 keeps ffmpeg on its fast, hardware-friendly path.

#                           keychain password and cannot work on a server.

#   metadata -- YouTube publishes this through the Data API, which authenticates
#               by API KEY and never judges the caller's IP. It answers in about
#               200ms against yt-dlp's ~8s on a good address (and minutes on a
#               blocked one, since that walks every client before giving up).
#               Free to 10,000 units/day; a videos.list call costs 1.
#
# So the preview -- the only thing between pasting a link and seeing the video,
